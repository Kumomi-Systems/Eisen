# Contributing to Eisen

Thanks for considering contributing to Eisen!

To get started, clone this repository and run the relevant setup script in the `setup` directory. Make your changes and build the OS by running `make`. You can then test said changes in QEMU by running `make run`.

Some guidelines to follow:
 - Use British English when writing code and documentation. If you're not sure what that's like, look at what [Johann](https://github.com/somecollagist) writes.
 - Formatting assumes use of tabs equivalent to four spaces.
 - Use LF, not CRLF (Windows users beware!)
 - Imports should be ordered alphabetically, with external dependencies imported before parts of the standard library.
